The Scores and Roster pages are built using Angular JS. To update, simply update the js files in data/ and the site should update automatically. Just make sure you link images properly.

Other pages are static and have to be updated manually.

Use roster-tool.html and score-tool.html to help you generate the data in the correct format. Also available here:
