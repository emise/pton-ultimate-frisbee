				<h2 id="1">History</h2>
				<p>
					The history of ultimate at Princeton began in 1972, when the first intercollegiate game was played between Princeton and Rutgers. Since then, the face of Princeton Ultimate has changed quite a bit. No longer the men of "Garden State Brickface," today, four teams represent Princeton Ultimate: competitive men's and women's teams both named Clockwork Orange, a developmental men's team named Clockblock, and a developmental women's team named Stopwatch.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2011, Clockwork Orange (W) placed 9th at D-III Nationals; in 2012, we finished 1st at D-III Regionals and competed at D-III Nationals. Traveling to Appleton, Wisconsin with only 9 players and a coach, we finished in 13th place. For the 2013 series, Clockwork's captains decided to compete in the D-I competition to see different teams. Soon after, in 2014, the University's matriculation exceeded the D-III maximum enrollment of 7,500 undergraduate and graduate students and Clockwork officially became a D-I school.
				</p>
				<h2 id="2">Who we are</h2>
				<p>
					For the 2014 - 2015 school year, Princeton Women's Clockwork Orange altogether boasted a roster of 27, the largest the team has seen in over five years. Going into the 2015-2016 year, we have decided to inaugurate a second team, aptly named Stopwatch, as a developmental team in order to accommodate our growing numbers and enhance the growth of each individual playerâ€™s skills. Each team has its set of three captains and coaches.
				</p>
				<p>
					The strength of our teams are composed of the hearts and spirit of every player. We are dedicated not only to the growth of our own individual ultimate skills, but also to the growth of our program and the development of women's ultimate as a rising force of positivity, competition, sportsmanship, and and most of all, fun. Despite having two teams, Clockwork and Stopwatch, we consider everyone a member of the Clockwork program.
				</p>
				<h2 id="3">Recent News</h2>
				<p>
					The 2014-2015 year has been our most successful to date. At the first tournament of the spring season, Bring the Huckus, we trampled through snow and ice to take home first place, snatching a win over Haverford. At both High Tide and Southerns, we finished in second place, losing to University of Connecticut and Auburn University respectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the guidance of Coach Kristin Franke, we finished first at D-I Eastern Metro East Conference Championships (Sectionals) in Colts Neck, New Jersey, defeating University of Connecticut in the final. Seeded second for Regionals, we were able to defeat University of Connecticut again in the final, securing a bid to D-I Nationals and making history for our program.
				</p>
				<p>
					At Nationals, we faced talented teams and saw that we could match up with them, saw what we needed to work on individually and as a program. We tied for 13th place with a win over Notre Dame, raising our rank from our original 20th (last) place seed. With the taste of Nationals on our tongues, we are hungry for a return to Nationals 2016 in Raleigh, NC!
				</p>
				<h2 id="4">Going forward</h2>
				<p>
					The talent on the team is growing. One of our players helped the US Women's U-19 national team take home the gold from youth world championships during the summer of 2014. Another teammate will be competing on the US Women's U-23 national team in London this summer; yet another qualified to compete on the Australian Mixed U-23 team.
				</p>
				<p>
					With so much under our belts now, we only look toward the future with hope and excitement.  The beginning of classes marks the first week of returner practices, while we hold pick up for those interested in learning and playing. We teach aggressively in the fall and winter, attending tournaments where we can in order to maximize player growth. In the winter, it's a mix of lifting and track workouts and bitter cold, night outdoor practices depending on whatever wintry mix gets thrown at us. Come spring break, we traditionally travel south with the men's teams to play in High Tide and Georgia Southerns. In April, we play in Sectionals and Regionals to round out our season.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Off the field, we study and hang out together as well, holding various social events to both encourage and enable us to bond together. We encourage all to come to pick up during the beginning of the year to try ultimate with us!
